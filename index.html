    <p>In botany, a tree is a perennial plant with an elongated stem, or trunk, usually supporting branches and leaves.
        In some usages, the definition of a tree may be narrower, e.g., including only woody plants with secondary
        growth, only plants that are usable as lumber, or only plants above a specified height.
